# Protocol Zero

## About

This is a quick tool to clear your online identities. Sometimes
deleting account is not enough as the service might just delete
your account but still retain all your messages with the OP's 
name hidden. This works partially but doesn't do you a lot of 
favor. 

*Protocol Zero* is used to delete the contents of your online 
accounts. This is more advantageous as you are still able to 
use your account afterwards. The tool *does not* delete accounts.

## Supported services

I wrote the first *Reddit* service for fun and it currently works
for cleanly deleting all your submissions and comments. Naturally,
we are looking at ability to delete all your messages from IMAP
mailboxes, clean Twitter feeds, etc.
